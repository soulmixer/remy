Software Engineering Test Task

You are asked to design and implement an execution system for pizza cooking
robots.

The system should consist of:
- 2 pizza ovens stacked one above the other	
- 2 robots before the ovens, each is able to:
	- Spread tomato sauce on a pizza crust
	- Scatter cheese over tomato sauce
	- Place pizza in one of the ovens
- 2 robots after the ovens, each is able to:
	- Pick pizza from one of the ovens
	- Slice it into pieces
	- Pack pizza into the box

You can assume that the only difference between robots is location and tools
available to them.

The system should support adding new robots easily. Currently the system includes
4 robots, and in the nearest future number of robots will be increased to 8.

Briefly describe your design and answer the following questions:
- What elements your system has?
- What are the interactions between those elements?
- What are the differences between cooking 1 pizza, 2 pizzas, and N pizzas?
- Why it is easy to add new robots into your system?
	
Implement the skeleton of your design to prove that it is sound and technically
feasible. You can use C++/Java/Python to do the implementation.
